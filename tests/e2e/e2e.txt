E2E stands for "end-to-end" testing. End-to-end testing is a method of testing an application or system as a whole, simulating the real-world interactions of users with the system. 
The purpose of e2e tests is to ensure that the application behaves correctly from the user's perspective, by testing the full stack of the application, 
from the user interface to the back-end services.

E2E tests are different from unit tests, which test individual components or functions in isolation, and integration tests, 
which test how different components or modules of the application interact with each other.
